Base serializer for use with :class:`pulpcore.app.models.Model`

This ensures that all Serializers provide values for the 'pulp_href` field.

The class provides a default for the ``ref_name`` attribute in the
ModelSerializers's ``Meta`` class. This ensures that the OpenAPI definitions
of plugins are namespaced properly.
