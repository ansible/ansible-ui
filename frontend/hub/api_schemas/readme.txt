Files in the folder generated are autogenerated files from swagger open api backend definition. The interfaces can be used as API response types, so we
dont have to create all of them manualy.

However, some of them may be incomplete. So we can create new ones for example in this folder and extends them from the generated ones. Do not directly modify generated ones as they
can be modified by generator in the future. Interfaces also include URL that they represent in the comment above interface for better searchability.

paths-and-object.txt contains all the generated objects and their respective url paths in one file.

Some of them may contains something like this:
PaginatedansibleCollectionVersionResponseList<AnsibleCollectionVersionResponse>
/api/pulp/api/v3/content/ansible/collection_versions/

This URL returns PaginatedansibleCollectionVersionResponseList, but inside, it returns collection of objects that are of type AnsibleCollectionVersionResponse
